Duuuude, I just finished watching Inception and my brain is in meltdown mode. Like, I can’t even tell if I’m still dreaming or what. Nolan pulled some mad genius stuff on all of us with this. Did you get a chance to download the movie yet? Seriously, I kinda feel like I need to watch the movie like five more times to even start getting half of it. 

So, like, are we supposed to just live with the idea that the top might still be spinning? Leo’s face was all “is this still real?” and I’m like, SAME! Also, through the whole movie, I'm just vibing with JGL, you know? That hallway fight scene… I probably need a minute before attempting to even think straight about gravity again. 

> Speaking of crazy, when Ariadne just strolled in there like “I’ll build a maze, and everyone’s just “cool” like, how chill can you be? You kinda wonder if you'd even survive a stroll inside your own brain like that. Probably find a dragon or a laundromat trying to kill me, who even knows! 

AND what’s up with the soundtrack being just bwaaaah every ten minutes? It felt both cool and like an alarm clock mashed up with some epic life crises. Zimmer is out there doing the mossttt.

Anyway, sorry, I’m rambling, but like, I was thinking about the dreams within dreams bit and now I’m not sure if I actually remembered to grab snacks for tomorrow… or wait, was that dream me prepping? Ugh. Existing is complicated AF after this movie.

Like that makes sense here, lol. But for reals, I feel like Cobb, but instead of totems, I'm spinning around caffeine levels and trying to keep thoughts from sloshing out of my head. Total admiration for the man, though. But yeah, let's catch up soon and brainstorm how to lucid dream, mkay?
